# README: Quick Guide to Connect to PostgreSQL in Docker

This guide provides simple instructions for setting up and connecting to a PostgreSQL database using Docker. The setup is designed for team members who need quick access to the database.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**
- Install Docker from [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).
- Ensure Docker is running by verifying the installation:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

---

## **2. Start PostgreSQL with Docker**
Run the following command to create and start a PostgreSQL container:

```bash
docker run --name hms-postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=admin \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=hms \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -d postgres
```

**Details:**
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`
- **Database**: `hms`
- **Port**: `5432`

---

## **3. Connecting to the Database**

### **Using a Client Tool**
You can connect to the database using a tool like DBeaver, pgAdmin, or any SQL client. Use the following settings:
- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Database**: `hms`
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

### **Using the Command Line**
Alternatively, connect to the database directly using Docker:
```bash
docker exec -it hms-postgres psql -U admin -d hms
```

---

## **4. Stopping and Restarting the Container**

### **Stop the Container**
To stop the PostgreSQL container, run:
```bash
docker stop hms-postgres
```

### **Restart the Container**
To restart the container, run:
```bash
docker start hms-postgres
```

---

## **5. Removing the Container**
If you need to delete the container (including all data):
```bash
docker rm -f hms-postgres
```

---

This setup ensures a consistent and shareable PostgreSQL environment for your team. Use the credentials provided to connect and start working immediately.


### **NU Housing Management System - Backend Service**

This repository contains the backend service for the **NU Housing Management System (HMS)**, built using **Java (Spring Boot)**. The backend serves as the core of the application, handling business logic, data processing, and communication with the frontend and database layers. 

#### **Key Features:**
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for residents, administrators, and service staff.
- **Room Allocation**: APIs for handling room allocation, relocation, and vacancy tracking.
- **Maintenance Management**: Endpoints to manage maintenance requests, task assignments, and issue tracking.
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with PostgreSQL to handle rental payments, utility bills, and deposit refunds.
- **Reporting Tools**: APIs to generate administrative reports, such as resident registries and financial summaries.
- **Secure Communication**: SSL encryption and authentication protocols to ensure secure data transmission.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker containers hosted on AWS
- **Testing Tools**: Postman for API testing
- **Version Control**: GitLab for collaboration and task tracking

#### **Repository Structure:**
- `/src/main/java`: Contains all backend logic, controllers, services, and models.
- `/src/main/resources`: Configuration files, including application properties for PostgreSQL and AWS integration.
- `/src/test/java`: Unit and integration tests for backend features.

#### **How to Run Locally:**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Ensure you have **Java 17+**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker** installed.
3. Update the `application.properties` file with your local PostgreSQL credentials.
4. Build the application:  
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
5. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

#### **Contributing:**
- Use feature branches for new functionalities and submit merge requests.
- Follow the project's coding standards and ensure all changes pass the provided tests before submission.
- Document all major changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

#### **Contact:**
For any issues or suggestions, please contact the **Team 55 Development Team**.
